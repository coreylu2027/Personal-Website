      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Corey Lu. I am a current junior at Mass Academy, and my sending school is
        <a href="https://www.arhs.nsboro.k12.ma.us">Algonquin Regional High School</a>.</p>
      <p>I have always loved to travel and experience new places. One of my favorite trips was to Banff and Jasper in
        Canada, where I had the chance to explore the breathtaking Canadian Rockies. I especially enjoyed hiking along
        the trails, biking through the mountain scenery, and spotting wildlife in their natural habitat.</p>
      <p>Being outdoors has always been something I value, whether it’s through travel or in my everyday life.</p>

      <h2>Activities</h2>
      <p>I am a member of <a href="https://www.troop1southborough.org">Troop 1 Southborough</a>, where scouting has
        helped me build leadership and enjoy the outdoors. I also enjoy programming and CAD design, combining
        problem-solving with creativity.</p>
      <p>I’m part of the <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/frc190/">robotics team</a>. For sports, I play tennis and golf and
