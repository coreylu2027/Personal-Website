      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Corey Lu. I am a current junior at Mass Academy, and my sending school is
        <a href="https://www.arhs.nsboro.k12.ma.us">Algonquin Regional High School</a>.</p>
      <p>I have always loved to travel and experience new places. One of my favorite trips was to Banff and Jasper in
        Canada, where I had the chance to explore the breathtaking Canadian Rockies. I especially enjoyed hiking along
        the trails, biking through the mountain scenery, and spotting wildlife in their natural habitat.</p>
      <p>Being outdoors has always been something I value, whether it’s through travel or in my everyday life.</p>

      <h2>Activities</h2>
      <p>I am a member of <a href="https://www.troop1southborough.org">Troop 1 Southborough</a>, where scouting has
        helped me build leadership and enjoy the outdoors. I also enjoy programming and CAD design, combining
        problem-solving with creativity.</p>
      <p>I am also a member of my school’s robotics team, <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/frc190/">FRC 190</a>, where we
        design, build, and program competitive robots for the FIRST Robotics Competition. Being part of the team gives
        me the opportunity to collaborate with other students on engineering challenges while learning hands-on skills
        in mechanical design, coding, and teamwork. Through competitions and projects, I get to apply STEM concepts in
        real-world scenarios while representing my school. </p>
      <p>For sports, I play tennis and golf and make time for hiking, biking, and camping.</p>

      <h2>At Home</h2>
      <p>I live with my mom, dad, and sister, plus two pets: a golden retriever named Bogey and a ragdoll cat named
        Rella. Bogey is 7 years old, and Rella is 11 years old. My sister is a Freshman at Algonquin.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I relax by watching movies and listening to music. I like listening to country and pop music.
        I watch football, hockey, basketball, and tennis.</p>
