    <h1>Advanced Physics</h1>
    <p>
      Advanced Physics, taught by Mrs. Chase, is a challenging, problem-solving-focused course that aligns with AP
      Physics C: Mechanics, including motion, forces, energy, momentum, and rotation. We use both algebra-based and
      calculus-based methods, with all necessary calculus taught in class, to analyze complex physical systems.

    <h2>Traffic Light POW</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      This assignment was a physics modeling problem focused on designing a safe and effective yellow traffic light
      timing. Working in a group, we developed a mathematical model that determines how long a traffic light should stay
      yellow based on factors such as vehicle speed, stopping distance, and intersection length. The project emphasized
      making clear assumptions, defining variables, creating and justifying a formula, and explaining our reasoning
      through a written problem-of-the-week (POW) report that also addressed real-world implications and safety
      considerations.

    <h2>Dynamics Lab</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      This dynamics lab investigated Newton’s Second Law by determining the force produced by a fan in a modified
      Atwood’s machine. By transferring mass between the cart and the hanging weight while keeping the total system mass
      constant, we measured how acceleration changed with hanging mass and tested whether the relationship was linear.
      Using free-body diagrams, experimental data, and a best-fit line, we compared theoretical and experimental results
      to evaluate the fan’s force and identify sources of error such as friction and thrust variability.
