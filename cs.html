    <h1>Computer Science</h1>
    <p>
      Mrs. Taricco teaches Advanced Computer Science. This is a course that focuses on both programming and real-world
      software development. The class starts with web design using HTML and CSS, where I build and maintain a personal
      and professional website, and then moves into object-oriented programming in Java. Throughout the year, we learn
      core computer science concepts. The course emphasizes problem-solving, collaboration, and writing efficient,
      well-structured code, and it includes major projects such as developing a mobile app to address a real community
      need.

    <h2>Binary Counting</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      This assignment was an ACSL “Binary Counting” challenge where you start with a normal text string, convert every
      character into its 8-bit ASCII binary, smash it all into one huge binary string, and then repeatedly delete the
      counting sequence (0, 1, 10, 11, 100, …) by searching from the front and then the back each time until you hit a
      number that can’t be found anymore. After that, you convert whatever binary is left into octal (no leading zeros)
      and repeat the same deletion process in base 8 (0, 1, 2, …, 7, 10, 11, …), and the final output is the last octal
      number you were able to delete (converted to base 10), or -1 if you can’t even delete 0.

    <h2>Dynamics Lab</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      This dynamics lab investigated Newton’s Second Law by determining the force produced by a fan in a modified
      Atwood’s machine. By transferring mass between the cart and the hanging weight while keeping the total system mass
      constant, we measured how acceleration changed with hanging mass and tested whether the relationship was linear.
      Using free-body diagrams, experimental data, and a best-fit line, we compared theoretical and experimental results
      to evaluate the fan’s force and identify sources of error such as friction and thrust variability.
