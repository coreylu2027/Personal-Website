    Modeling and Analysis of Wildfire Behavior in New England Using FARSITE
  </h2>

  <div class="assignment">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      This project evaluates and improves the performance of FARSITE wildfire spread simulations
      for New England forests. While wildfire modeling tools are widely used in the western United
      States, they are rarely calibrated for the humid, deciduous-dominated ecosystems of the
      Northeast. By validating simulations against documented wildfire perimeters and systematically
      tuning fuel models and weather inputs, this study develops a regionally informed modeling
      framework. Results demonstrate that fuel representation plays a larger role in improving
      spatial agreement than meteorological scaling alone, and that wildfire activity in New England
      exhibits a bimodal seasonal pattern driven by spring drying and fall drought conditions.

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p class="assignment-description scroll abstract">Wildfire risk in the Northeastern United States has historically received less
        attention than in the West, yet recent evidence shows that large wildfires in eastern forests are increasing in
        frequency and severity. New England presents a distinct fire regime characterized by humid climates,
        deciduous-dominated fuels, strong seasonal variability, and dense wildland–urban interfaces, conditions that are
        poorly represented in existing wildfire spread models developed for Western ecosystems. This project develops a
        regionally calibrated wildfire prediction framework for Massachusetts by validating and adapting FARSITE
        simulations using locally relevant fuel models, high-resolution meteorological data, and documented wildfire
        perimeters. Sensitivity analyses show that fuel moisture and wind speed strongly influence final burn area,
        though they do not substantially reduce spatial mismatches between simulated and observed perimeters. Calibrated
        simulations using different fuel models improved model performance to match 66% of observed fire perimeters.
        Independent validation on a separate wildfire confirmed enhanced generalization of the tuned fuel parameters.
        Seasonal simulations identified a bimodal wildfire season in New England, matching fire occurrence data. </p>

      <h2>Phase 1: Research Question</h2>
      <p class="assignment-description">To what extent does tuning fuel model and weather inputs in FARSITE improve
        agreement between simulated and observed wildfire perimeters in New England? How do variations in fuels and
        climate conditions affect wildfire intensity across the region?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="assignment">
      <h2>Phase 2: Project Aims & Hypotheses</h2>
      <p class="assignment-description">The aim of this project is to develop a regionally informed evaluation of
        FARSITE wildfire simulations in New England by analyzing modeled fire behavior and refining model inputs through
        sensitivity analysis and fuel model calibration. The resulting model was then applied to assess fire behavior
        across varied environmental conditions, facilitating more reliable interpretation of simulated wildland fire
        dynamics. I hypothesize that the resulting model will improve model accuracy compared to uncalibrated
        simulations.
        Additionally, I believe that model results will match fire occurrence data showing a bimodal fire season.</p>

    <div class="assignment">
      <h2>Background (Detailed Description)</h2>
      <p class="assignment-description scroll">Wildfire risk in the United States has traditionally been viewed as a
        predominantly western problem, driven by arid climates, extensive forests, and large, high-severity fire events.
        In contrast, the forests of the Northeastern United States have long been considered relatively fire-resistant
        due to their humid climate, and historically smaller fire sizes. However, recent research indicates that this
        assumption is outdated (Donovan et al., 2023). Large wildfires in the eastern United States are becoming more
        frequent and more severe, highlighting the need for improved understanding wildfire behavior outside of
        traditionally studied western ecosystems.
        Fuel load, the amount of burnable live and dead vegetation, strongly influences wildfire intensity. In many
        eastern forests, decades of fire suppression and land-use change have allowed fuels to accumulate. Woody
        vegetation cover has increased by approximately 37% across the eastern U.S. over the past 30 years, largely due
        to agricultural abandonment and reduced fire occurrence (Ivey et al., 2024). Increased woody fuels are linked to
        higher wildfire risk: each 1% increase in woody cover corresponds to roughly a 3.9% increase in the odds of a
        large fire in parts of the East. Regions such as eastern Texas and the southern Appalachians have experienced up
        to a tenfold increase in large wildfire frequency over four decades as forests and understories have densified.
        In contrast, the cooler and wetter Northeast has shown a weaker relationship between fuel buildup and large
        fires, indicating that fuel load alone does not determine fire outcomes (Ivey et al., 2024). However, heavy
        fuels remain a necessary condition for high-intensity fires when ignitions and favorable weather coincide. Fuel
        treatments such as prescribed burning and thinning are therefore critical management tools, as long-term fire
        suppression has been shown to exacerbate fuel accumulation and increase fire severity when fires do occur
        (Kreider et al., 2024).
        Wildfire activity in the Northeast is highly seasonal, with a pronounced peak in April and May. A climatological
        study of 155 Northeast wildfires (1999–2009) found that approximately 59% of large fires (≥100 acres) occurred
        during these two months, driven by pre-green-up conditions, rapid spring drying, and persistent high-pressure
        systems that produce warm, dry, and windy weather (Pollina et al., 2013). Notably, many Northeast wildfires
        occur without meeting traditional Red Flag Warning criteria, suggesting that fire-weather thresholds developed
        for western regions may not accurately capture fire risk in New England. This spring-dominated and
        meteorologically distinct fire season has important implications for regional fire modeling and prediction.
        Climate and weather strongly regulate wildfire intensity by controlling fuel moisture and ignition potential.
        Key variables include temperature, precipitation, and drought indices such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index
        and Fire Weather Index. Elevated temperatures and reduced precipitation dry fuels and increase combustion
        intensity, while drought indices capture prolonged moisture deficits that predispose landscapes to severe fires.
        In the historically wetter East, climate variability can sharply distinguish mild fire seasons from extreme
        ones.
        Studies in the Northeast show that large fires tend to coincide with periods of climatic water deficit (Carlson
        et al., 2021). The 2016 southern Appalachian fires, for example, occurred during one of the warmest and driest
        autumns on record, when drought and leaf litter accumulation enabled high-intensity fire behavior, including
        wind-driven crown fires (Reilly et al., 2022). Climate change is expected to exacerbate these conditions by
        lengthening fire seasons and increasing the frequency of hot, dry weather. Importantly, climate and fuel effects
        interact: drought can both dry existing fuels and increase dead fuel loads through vegetation stress and
        mortality, amplifying fire intensity once ignitions occur (Donovan et al., 2023).

      <h2>Procedure (Detailed Description)</h2>
      <p class="assignment-description scroll abstract">
        All data used in this study were obtained from open-source repositories. Spatial datasets describing fuels,
        vegetation, and topography were sourced from the LANDFIRE program. Meteorological inputs were obtained through
        the Open-Meteo API. Fire behavior and spread simulations were conducted using the FlamMap and FARSITE modeling
        systems.
        Wildfire spread simulations were conducted using the FARSITE fire area simulator and FlamMap fire behavior
        modeling system. These tools were selected because they implement established, physics-based models of fire
        spread that account for fuels, topography, and weather, making them well suited for landscape-scale fire
        behavior analysis. FARSITE was used to simulate time-dependent fire growth from an ignition point or perimeter,
        while FlamMap was used to analyze spatial patterns in fire behavior under static environmental conditions.
        Baseline simulations were ran using unmodified parameters and datasets.
        Parameter studies were ran by changing a parameter by a certain factor or to a selected value. The windy study
        was conducted by running multiple runs on different wind factors at 40% to 160% of the original values. The fuel
        moisture study used 5 different fuel moisture settings including very dry to very moist. These values were
        selected by looking at acceptable and realistic fuel moistures commonly found in the scientific community.
        Model calibration was performed by systematically adjusting fuel model assignments and fuel moisture parameters
        to reduce discrepancies between simulated fire perimeters and observed fire perimeters from historical wildfire
        events. Calibration was necessary because default fuel models and moisture values are generalized and may not
        accurately represent fuel conditions in New England forests. The effectiveness of calibration was evaluated by
        comparing simulated and observed fire extents using quantitative spatial overlap metrics.
        To evaluate the agreement between simulated fire perimeters and observed fire perimeters, a spatial
        overlap–based measure of fit was used. Traditional point-based statistical tests (e.g., correlation or
        regression) are not well-suited for comparing spatial extents, as they do not directly account for geometric
        agreement or spatial misalignment. Instead, a set-based similarity metric was selected to directly quantify the
        degree of overlap between modeled and observed burned areas.
        Model performance was quantified using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, a widely used measure for
        evaluating similarity between two spatial regions. IoU compares the area of overlap between the simulated burned
        area (A<sub>sim</sub>) and the observed burned area (A<sub>obs</sub>) relative to their combined extent. This
        metric is particularly appropriate for wildfire modeling because it penalizes both under-prediction and
        over-prediction of fire spread while remaining insensitive to absolute area scale.
        The IoU metric is defined as:
        <span class="math">IoU = (A<sub>sim</sub> &cap; A<sub>obs</sub>) / (A<sub>sim</sub> &cup; A<sub>obs</sub>)</span>
        Where A<sub>sim</sub> &cap; A<sub>obs</sub> represents the intersection (overlapping area) of the simulated and
        observed fire perimeters, and A<sub>sim</sub> &cup; A<sub>obs</sub> represents their union (total combined
        area). IoU values range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates no spatial overlap and a value of 1 indicates
        perfect agreement between the modeled and observed fire extents.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      Baseline FARSITE simulations underpredicted total burned area and exhibited notable spatial
      mismatches relative to observed fire perimeters. Sensitivity analyses revealed that wind speed
      and fuel moisture strongly influenced total burn extent, but increases in burn area did not
      consistently improve spatial agreement as measured by Intersection over Union (IoU).
      Calibration of fuel model assignments produced the largest improvement in model performance,
      increasing IoU agreement to 0.66 for the primary case study fire. Independent validation on a
      separate wildfire confirmed that tuned fuel parameters generalized beyond a single event.
      Seasonal simulations further identified two distinct peaks in modeled fire potential: a
      dominant April–May peak associated with pre-green-up drying and a secondary fall peak linked
      to drought conditions. These findings suggest that accurate fuel representation is more
      critical than meteorological scaling alone for improving wildfire spread predictions in
      New England.

  <div class="assignment">
    <h2>Discussion &amp; Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="assignment-description">
      This study demonstrates that wildfire modeling frameworks developed for western U.S.
      ecosystems require regional calibration before application to New England landscapes.
      Default LANDFIRE fuel models do not fully capture the structure and moisture dynamics of
      northeastern mixed hardwood forests, leading to systematic underprediction of spread.
      Fuel model tuning substantially improved spatial agreement, indicating that vegetation
      representation is a primary source of modeling uncertainty in this region.

      While meteorological adjustments influenced fire size, they did not significantly correct
      spatial errors, highlighting the importance of accurate fuels over simple weather scaling.
      The identification of a bimodal wildfire season aligns with historical fire occurrence
      studies and suggests that regional fire-weather thresholds may need revision.

      This calibrated modeling framework provides a foundation for improved wildfire hazard
      assessment, seasonal risk forecasting, and future integration with burn probability or
      machine-learning–based fire occurrence models tailored specifically to New England.
